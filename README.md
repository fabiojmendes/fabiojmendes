# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fabio and welcome to my GitHub repo. I'm passionate about all things
related to programming languages, hardware & software, and distributed systems.
Iâ€™m also a homelabber and enjoy running various projects on my own
infrastructure.

I'm senior architect mostly working with Java Microservices, Kafka and a variety
of different data stores like Redis, MySQL, OpenSearch, and Databricks.  So I
use this space as a conduit to express my interests and creativity about
embedded systems, hardware design, and low level programming that I don't get to
do on my day job.

## Worth Noting Projects and Repos

### Autosys

Miscellaneous projects using, mainly rust, that have a component of
embedded systems and custom PCB design. But nonetheless it is a distributed
system using mqtt to wire up the various components. The motivation behind these
is mostly to provide some level of automation to a commercial facility.
Check the [repo](https://github.com/fabiojmendes/Autosys) for more details

### FabiOS

Pandemic was in full swing so of course I had to implement my own operating
system. Never really got much further than going through the bootloader piece
and printing some text on the screen. But still a very interesting deep dive on
the absolute *mess* that it is to initialize an x86 box. [repo](https://github.com/fabiojmendes/FabiOS)

### Raft Rust

A quick attempt at implementing the [Raft Consensus Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(algorithm))
in rust. Mostly for self studies purposes and you guessed *pandemic*.

### Super Jeff

I like playing games and always wanted to write one myself. I tried a few
times over the years but would never get passed the prototype stage.
Finishing things is an art. This time around I wanted it to be different. Also
pandemic... Even though it is a simple game, it is a complete game with
graphics, physics, audio and an objective. My friends had a blast playing and a
real hard time killing the boss, so that alone made me feel accomplished.
It is also published to the
[arewegameyet](https://arewegameyet.rs/games/platformer/#super-jeff) website.

From the technical side it was also a fun challenge. Probably my first rust
program past the hello world stage. I also wanted to go for a more bare bones
approach without using a full game engine so I also had to figure out a bit of
math along the way. [repo](https://github.com/fabiojmendes/super-jeff)
