# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fabio and welcome to my GitHub repo. I'm passionate about all things
related to programming languages, hardware & software, and distributed systems.
Iâ€™m also a homelabber and enjoy running various projects on my own
infrastructure.

I'm senior architect mostly working with Java Microservices, Kafka and a variety
of different data stores like Redis, MySQL, OpenSearch, and Databricks.  So I
use this space as a conduit to express my interests and creativity about
embedded systems, hardware design, and low level programming that I don't get to
do on my day job.
