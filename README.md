# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fabio and welcome to my GitHub repo. I'm passionate about all things
related to programming languages, hardware & software, and distributed systems.
Iâ€™m also a homelabber and enjoy running various projects on my own
infrastructure.

I'm senior architect mostly working with Java Microservices, Kafka and a variety
of different data stores like Redis, MySQL, OpenSearch, and Databricks.  So I
use this space as a conduit to express my interests and creativity about
embedded systems, hardware design, and low level programming that I don't get to
do on my day job.

## Noteworthy Projects and Repos

### Autosys

Miscellaneous automation projects mainly using rust that have a component of
embedded systems and custom PCB design. Nonetheless it is a distributed system
using mqtt to wire up the various components. The motivation behind these is
mostly to provide a level of automation to a commercial facility. Check
[Autosys](https://github.com/fabiojmendes/Autosys) for more details.

### FabiOS

Pandemic was in full swing so of course I had to implement my own operating
system. Never really got much further than going through the bootloader piece
and printing some text on the screen. Still a very interesting deep dive on
the absolute **mess** that it is to initialize an x86 box.
Check [FabiOS](https://github.com/fabiojmendes/FabiOS) for more details.

### Super Jeff

I like playing games and always wanted to write one myself. I tried a few times
over the years but would never get passed the prototype stage.  Finishing things
is an art. This time around I wanted it to be different. Also pandemic... Even
though it is a simple game, it is a complete game with graphics, physics, audio
and an objective. My friends had a blast playing and a real hard time killing
the boss, so that alone made me feel accomplished.  It is also published to the
[arewegameyet](https://arewegameyet.rs/games/platformer/#super-jeff) website.

From the technical side it was also a fun challenge. Probably my first rust
program past the hello world stage. I also wanted to go for a more bare bones
approach without using a full game engine so I also had to figure out a bit of
math along the way.

### Raft Rust

A quick attempt at implementing the [Raft Consensus
Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(algorithm)) in rust. Mostly for
self studies purposes and you guessed *pandemic*. It doesn't actually implement
storage bit, the focus was more on the leader election part.
Check [raft-rust](https://github.com/fabiojmendes/raft-rust) for more details.
