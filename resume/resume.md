## SUMMARY

As a Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience, I have successfully
navigated projects from developing embedded systems and programming
microcontrollers to architecting and implementing large scale distributed
systems. I lead by example, prioritizing quality and sustainability in every
project. My goal is to create robust systems that not only meet present
requirements but are also adaptable for future needs.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### RubyLife – Senior Software Architect (Sep/2017 – Present)

As an architect, my main role is to provide technical leadership to the
developers, ensuring alignment with the company's vision. Setting standards,
unblocking initiatives, and engaging in research and development are part of my
day-to-day tasks. Documenting my findings and being able to communicate them
effectively across the organization to both technical and non-technical
stakeholders is also crucial.

The main challenges come in the form of integration between our own platform,
third-party products, and services from various cloud providers. Focus is also
given to the modernization of our engineering practices. To that end, I
regularly engage in coding activities, mostly in the form of proof of concepts
that help spread knowledge.

2017 – 2020 Senior Software Developer/Team Lead/Dev Manager

I joined the company in 2017, tasked with leading a team to replatform its
existing system and bring it to a more modern era using Microservices, Kafka,
and Kubernetes. During this time, I also gained experience as a development
manager, helping to establish the hiring process and consolidate our engineering
culture. After this valuable and interesting period, I decided to return to
being an individual contributor by taking on the position of architect.

- Technologies/Tools: Java, Spring, Kafka, Debezium, MySQL, Redis, ELK,
  Kubernetes, AWS, Nginx, TypeScript, Cloudflare Workers, Hashicorp Vault, and
  OpenSearch.

### PointClickCare – Senior Software Developer (Nov/2014 – Sep/2017)

PointClickCare has a very strong SAS product in the LTPAC (Long Term Post Acute
Care) segment. My key responsibilities there as senior developer of one of the
scrum teams was to handle the more technical challenging tasks, perform code
reviews and mentor other developers. Later on, with the focus on
interoperability and to extend the platform, my team was involved on API and
integration projects.

- Technologies/Tools: Java, JEE, Web Development, Spring (Core, MVC and Boot),
  MS Sql Server, REST APIs

### Navita Tecnologia Ltda - Senior Software Architect (Feb/2006 – Oct/2014)

Navita acquired a company specialized in telecom management, and we collaborated
to enhance the existing solution. We redesigned the bill processing module by
replacing outdated Delphi components. The new system utilizes Spring Batch to
read files with millions of lines and process complex billing rules. By
incorporating Domain Driven Design principles and rigorous unit testing, we
achieved a robust and maintainable codebase. The performance improvements were
significant, reducing the time required to process one million records from
twelve hours to just ten minutes.

- Technologies/Tools: Java, Spring (Core, Integration Batch), Hibernate, JPA,
  NIO, TDD, DDD, PostgreSQL and Linux.

2010 – 2013 Senior Software Architect

After selling Navita Portal to a Spanish company, the focus shifted towards the
telecom sector. We developed a new solution, Navita TEM (Telecom Expense
Management) Mobile, designed to manage smartphone expenses. This multi-tenant
application oversees voice, text, and data consumption, leveraging technologies
such as Spring, Hibernate, Tomcat, and REST services. Additionally, we created
applications for all major mobile platforms (iOS, Android, and BlackBerry) that
function as data probes, collecting information and transmitting it to the
backend for processing.

- Technologies/Tools: Java, Spring, Hibernate, JPA, Struts 2, Freemarker, REST,
  PostgreSQL, Linux and Multi-Tenancy.

2007 – 2010 Software Architect

In 2007, Navita decided to invest in a complete redesign of its flagship
product, Navita Content. The transition from ColdFusion to Java involved
assembling a team of top performers and I was a key member of this initiative.
Following the departure of the lead architect, I took on the responsibilities of
the lead architect role. The product was rebranded as Navita Portal 2.0, a CMS
and corporate portal tool built on Java EE standards, including JPA, Servlets,
and Portlets. This adherence to established technologies ensured portability
across various application servers and RDBMS for on-premises installations.
Among our many clients, Cielo, Brazil's largest credit card processing company,
successfully implemented this solution for their Internet portal.

- Technologies/Tools: Java, JEE, JMS, OSCache, Spring, Hibernate, JPA, Struts 2,
  Freemarker, Web Services, Portlets (JSR 168), Javascript, Oracle, SQL Server,
  PostgreSQL, Glassfish, Weblogic, and JMeter.

2006 – 2007 Software Developer

I started my career at Navita as a software developer, where I participated in
various projects utilizing technologies such as Struts 1, JDBC, JavaScript, and
clients for EJBs and Web Services. One of the most significant projects involved
developing a bespoke product for a paper factory to automate their audit
process. We implemented a comprehensive set of their rules into a tailored
system using technologies such as Hibernate (with XDoclet), Spring, and JSF. I
played a key role in the architecture of this solution.

- Technologies/Tools: Java, JEE, Web Development, Struts 1, Hibernate, Spring,
  XDoclet, and JSF.

### RW Veronezi Informatica - Programmer Analyst (Jun/2005 – Jan/2006)

I contributed to the development of a cross-platform desktop application
designed for configuring PABX systems. The project prioritized portability
across Windows, macOS, and Linux, utilizing Java and Swing as the primary
technologies.

- Technologies/Tools: Java, Desktop Development, Swing, and Serial
  Communication.

### Matelfone Telecomunicações LTDA. - Programmer (Feb/2002 – Jun/2005)

Managed the configuration and maintenance of PABX systems, telephony recording
equipment, and network switches and routers. Designed a circuit board to
integrate PABX with speaker systems using a microcontroller and assembly
language. Additionally, developed a rudimentary intranet using PHP and MySQL to
enhance internal communication.

- Technologies/Tools: Linux, Intel 8051, PHP, and MySQL.
